## Unit Test
Unit testing is a way of testing an application by breaking the application down into its smallest constituent parts and testing each part in isolation. In order to test parts of an application that rely on other code, unit tests typically use mock objects to make sure that problems elsewhere in the code won't cause the tests to mistakenly fail.

Unit testing is often automated at larger or more sophisticated companies.

## Integration Test
Integration testing is a form of testing in which units of code are combined ("integrated") and the results of their interactions are tested. This type of testing is done after each of the individual units has been tested.

## Test Coverage
"Test coverage" refers to how much of a software program has been tested. This can refer to several things, including the percentage of functions that have been called by the test suite, or the percentage of statements in the code that have been executed by the test suite.
